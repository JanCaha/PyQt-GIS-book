  abstract  = {Learn {GUI} application development from the ground up, taking a practical approach by building simple projects that teach the fundamentals of using {PyQt}. Each chapter gradually moves on to teach more advanced and diverse concepts to aid you in designing interesting applications using the latest version of {PyQt}. Youll start by reviewing the beginning steps of {GUI} development from, using different projects in every chapter to teach new widgets or concepts that will help you to build better {UIs}. As you follow along, you will construct more elaborate {GUIs},covering topics that include storing data using the clipboard, graphics and animation, support for {SQL} databases, and multithreading applications. Using this knowledge, youll be able to build a photo editor, games, a text editor, a working web browser and an assortment of other {GUIs}. Beginning {PyQt} will guide you through the process of creating {UIs} to help you bring your own ideas to life. Learn what is necessary to begin making your own applications and more with {PyQt}! You will: Create your own cross-platform {GUIs} with {PyQt} and Python Use {PyQts} many widgets and apply them to building real applications Build larger applications and break the steps into smaller parts for deeper understanding Work with complex applications in {PyQt}, from animation to databases and more.},
